Exercise 1: Weather Station
Design Weather Station
easy
Build a basic weather station system. A WeatherStation subject broadcasts temperature, humidity, and pressure readings. Two observers respond to each update: CurrentConditionsDisplay shows the latest reading, and StatisticsDisplay tracks and displays the average temperature across all readings received so far.

Requirements:

Subject interface with register, remove, notify
WeatherStation with setMeasurements(temp, humidity, pressure) that notifies observers
CurrentConditionsDisplay prints the latest temperature, humidity, and pressure
StatisticsDisplay tracks all temperature readings and prints the average temperature
