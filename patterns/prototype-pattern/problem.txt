Exercise 1: Shape Cloning
Implement Shape Cloning
easy
Problem: Implement a Shape prototype system with Circle and Rectangle classes. Each shape has a color and dimensions. Clone a circle and a rectangle, modify the clones, and verify the originals are unaffected.

Requirements:

Circle has color, radius
Rectangle has color, width, height
Both implement a Cloneable interface with a clone() method
After cloning, modifying the clone must not affect the original
