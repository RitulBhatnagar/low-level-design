Exercise 1: Theme Factory
Design Theme Factory
easy
Problem: Build a theming system for a UI framework. 
Each theme (Light and Dark) produces two related products: a ThemeColor and a ThemeFont. The abstract factory ensures that colors and fonts from the same theme are always used together.

Requirements:

ThemeColor interface with a apply() method
ThemeFont interface with a render() method
LightColor prints "Applying light color: #FFFFFF background, #000000 text"
DarkColor prints "Applying dark color: #1E1E1E background, #FFFFFF text"
LightFont prints "Rendering light theme font: Arial, 14px"
DarkFont prints "Rendering dark theme font: Consolas, 14px"
ThemeFactory with createColor() and createFont() methods





EXERCISE-2 Cloud Infrastructure Provisioner (Abstract Factory)

Design a multi-cloud system supporting AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Requirements:
- Each cloud has: VirtualMachine, Storage, Database, LoadBalancer
- AWS   → EC2, S3, RDS, ALB
- GCP   → ComputeEngine, CloudStorage, CloudSQL, CloudLB
- Azure → AzureVM, BlobStorage, AzureSQL, AzureLB
- InfraService should provision without knowing the cloud

Expected:
- 4 abstract product interfaces
- 3 concrete families (12 classes total)
- AbstractFactory + 3 concrete factories
- InfraService as client
